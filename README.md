# youtube playlist organizer
Improved and optimized version of "YouTube (Modern) | Sort, Rearrange &amp; Organize Playlists 2"

## Installation
1. Install Tampermonkey browser extension
2. Click on playlistorganizer.user.js in the files
3. Press "Raw"
4. The script will be installed

## Usage
This script works in the new YouTube Polymer design, with playlists of any length.
Some new buttons will be created on the top of the playlist page.

## Contributions
There is room for improvement, especially with the timing. I'll try to further develop the script if I have more time.


## Troubleshooting
If you have a slower PC or internet connection, you might have to adjust the timings:

Go to Tampermonkey->Dashboard, click on the script.  
Increase `const scrollPauseDuration = 10000` (ms) if more time is needed for scrolling and loading  
Increase `const movePauseDuration = 4000` (ms) if you more time is needed when moving items

Feel free to open an issue if you have any problems
